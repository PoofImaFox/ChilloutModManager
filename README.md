# ChilloutModManager
This is an open source Mod Manager for ChilloutVR. This is not a very serious project, I am just working on this in my spare time to write my own mods into the game. If you would like to help, go for it! :) Just please follow my editor config. 

# Plans?
Well one of the features I am really pushing towards implementing is the ability to edit CIL in real-time. I will be working on a mod that will patch the CIL and then call ClrJit to re compile those instructions. This will allow you to fiddle with the game code without having to restart the game an excessive amount of times.

Mods I guess? This is all just a hobby project for me so I am not taking it very seriously or planned out.

# PRs?
If you have a pull request, I will look at it as soon as I can. Remember this is only a hobby project and may lose any of my support at any time. Ontop of that I'm pretty sure Chillout plans on implementing a mod manager right inside of their game :)
